INSTALLATION

Simply running "make" will compile the genkeys and asleap tools.  If you want to
actively deauthenticate users on wireless networks, you will need the AirJack
drivers from http://802.11ninja.net/.  Reading from a live interface or from a
capture file requires the interface/capture to be in RFMON mode 
(DLT_IEEE802_11).  You can also supply an AiroPeek NX capture file if you have
that tool available (just pass the filename to asleap with the "-r" flag).
