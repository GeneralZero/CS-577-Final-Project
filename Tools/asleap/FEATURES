A quick list of features:

New in version 1.4:

+ Recovers weak PPTP passwords (new!).
+ Handles dictionary and genkeys files up to 4 TB in size.
+ Can read live from any wireless interface in RFMON mode (DLT_IEEE802_11,
  DLT_TZSP).
+ Can read live from any network interface in Ethernet or Ethernet-
  compatibility mode (DLT_EN10MB).  This was intended to let Windows users
  capture LEAP transactions without RFMON support, but is also useful to
  capture PPTP transactions on wireless or wired networks.
+ Added getopt to genkeys for advanced command-line parameter support.
+ Can read from STDIN with genkeys, useful to combining genkeys with John the
  Ripper to create custom dictionaries.
+ Support for a standard dictionary attack without genkeys databases (-W).
  Useful for trying to recover a password from a transaction that isn't in
  your dictionary file when you have a lot of time, or little disk space.


Features from version 1.0:

+ Recovers weak LEAP passwords.
+ Can monitor a single channel, or perform channel hopping to look for
  targets.
+ Will actively deauthenticate users on LEAP networks, forcing them to
  reauthenticate.  This makes the capture of LEAP passwords very fast.
+ Will only deauth users who have not already been seen, doesn't waste time
  on users who are not running LEAP.
+ Can read from stored libpcap files in RFMON mode (DLT_IEEE802_11), 
  or AiroPeek NX files (1.X or 2.X files).
+ Uses a dynamic database table and index to make lookups on large
  files very fast.  Reduces the worst-case search time to .0015% as opposed
  to lookups in a flat file.
+ Can write *just* the LEAP exchange information to a libpcap file.  This
  could be used to capture LEAP credentials with a device short on disk
  space (like an iPaq), and then process the LEAP credentials stored in the
  libpcap file on a system with more storage resources.
+ Partial functionality on Windows, reading from supported capture files.
+ Probably other stuff I forgot, check the code or ask me.
